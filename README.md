# Raindrops

A program that checks to see if an integer has 3, 5 and 7 as a factor, and returns a string.  If the integer has 3 as a factor, the string will be "Pling", 5 and it will be "Plang", 7 and it will be "Plong".  If it has both 3 and 7, the string will be "PlingPlang" and so on. If it has none of these factors,  the programme returns the integer as a string.
